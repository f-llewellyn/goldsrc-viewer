# Goldsrc-viewer

This is a tool that will allow you to view most goldsrc maps and demos (essentially all main games except blue shift) in your web browser with the use of the [hlviewer.js](https://github.com/skyrim/hlviewer.js?files=1) library kindly provided by [skyrim](https://github.com/skyrim/) on github. At the moment it only displays a one map with a demo but hopefully I will be able to expand functionality to allow the use of locally stored assets using the Filesystem Access API. It's written using TailwindCSS
